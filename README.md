📊 Advanced Telecom Customer Churn Analysis using Power BI

📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges in the telecom industry. Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. Therefore, understanding customer behavior and identifying churn patterns is essential for improving retention strategies.
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes telecom customer churn data to uncover key insights, high-risk customer segments, and major churn drivers.
The goal of this project is to transform raw telecom customer data into meaningful, data-driven insights using Business Intelligence tools.

🎯 Project Objectives
✅ Objective 1:
Analyze the relationship between customer tenure, monthly spending, and total revenue to identify churn-prone high-revenue customers with low tenure.
✅ Objective 2:
Visualize the proportion of churned vs retained customers to understand overall churn distribution.
✅ Objective 3:
Study how churn rate varies across customer tenure to identify early-stage churn risks.
✅ Objective 4:
Examine how different contract types (month-to-month, one-year, two-year) influence churn behavior.
✅ Objective 5:
Use AI-based Key Influencers analysis to automatically detect major factors impacting churn.
